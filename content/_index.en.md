During our DevOps journey, we use a multitude tools and infrastructure, and
encounter many problems.

Sometimes we judge that it is not necessary to document certain situations,
thinking that we will no longer encounter these problems.

However, recently I have been working with different startups and have found
myself realized that I found myself repeating practically the same tasks.

This is why I decided to create this site to document the tools that we use as
well as to record the problems we face in our daily lives and provide their
solutions.
