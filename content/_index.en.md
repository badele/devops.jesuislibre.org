During our DevOps journey, we use a multitude tools and infrastructure, and
encounter many problems.

Sometimes we judge that it is not necessary to document certain situations,
thinking that we will no longer encounter these problems.

However, recently I have been working with different startups and have found
myself realized that I found myself repeating practically the same tasks.

This is why I decided to create this site to document the tools that we use as
well as to record the problems we face in our daily lives and provide their
solutions.

## Clarification on the use of AI

{{< hint type="note" title="Note" >}}

This clarification follows an AI manifesto that I saw on the site
[A cup of coffee](https://une-tasse-de.cafe/ai/).

{{< /hint >}}

The use of artificial intelligence in this process aims mainly to facilitate the
creation of content and to ensure writing without error. However, every decision
regarding content, as well as finalization of each article remains under my
responsibility.

### Content development

I use artificial intelligence tools in the same way that we would use a spell
checker or language translator.

- **Reformulation of sentences:** To improve the fluidity and clarity of texts,
  AI can suggest reformulations that enrich the content while while preserving
  the original meaning.

- **Correction of spelling and grammar errors:** AI makes it possible to
  automatically detect and correct linguistic errors, ensuring thus a text
  without errors.

### English version

The English version of this site is entirely based on the French version which I
translate using one of these 3 tools:

- **OpenAI, DeepL, Google Translate** (via Vim)

Cette clarification fait suite à un manifeste IA que j'ai vu sur le site
[Une tasse de café](https://une-tasse-de.cafe/ai/).
